# SUSE AI Operator
The SUSE AI Extension Operator installs and manages Rancher UI extension for SUSE AI using a declarative Kubernetes Custom Resource (CR). It acts as a bridge between Helm-based extension packaging and Rancher UIPlugin resources, handling lifecycle, validation, retries, and cleanup in a Kubernetes-native way.

## Purpose
This operator exists to:
- Install SUSE AI Rancher UI extensions safely and declaratively.
- Prevent conflicts with operator-unmanaged Helm resources.
- Manage Helm releases, ClusterRepos, and UIPlugins.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go v1.24.0+
- docker v17.03+
- kubectl v1.11.3+
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster
- Helm 3.x
- Rancher installed (for UIPlugin and ClusterRepo integration)

The following CRDs must exist before adding the operator:
  - `uiplugins.catalog.cattle.io`
  - `clusterrepos.catalog.cattle.io`

### Installation

The operator is distributed as a Helm chart and installs:
- Controller Deployment
- RBAC
- CRDs
- Metrics Service

1. **Install the SUSE AI Operator.** First, install the operator via Helm:

```sh
helm install aif-operator \
  -n aif-operator \
  --create-namespace \
  oci://ghcr.io/suse/chart/aif-operator
```

This will deploy the SUSE AI Operator into the `aif-operator` namespace.

2. **Create the InstallAIExtension CR.** Once the operator is installed, apply the InstallAIExtension Custom Resource (CR) to install the extension:

```yaml
apiVersion: ai-platform.suse.com/v1alpha1
kind: InstallAIExtension
metadata:
  name: aif-ui
spec:
  source:
    kind: Helm
    helm:
      chartURL: "oci://ghcr.io/suse/chart/aif-ui"
      version: "0.1.0"
  extension:
    name: aif-ui
    version: "0.1.0"
```

Apply the CR:
```sh
kubectl apply -f extension.yaml
```

### Uninstall

1. **Remove the InstallAIExtension CR.** To remove the InstallAIExtension CR, use:
```sh
kubectl delete -f extension.yaml
```

2. **Uninstall the SUSE AI Operator.** To uninstall the operator, run the following command:
```sh
helm uninstall aif-operator -n aif-operator
```

3. **Delete the CRDs.** After uninstalling the operator, you remove the associated Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs). To delete the InstallAIExtension CRD, use:
```sh
kubectl delete crd installaiextensions.ai-platform.suse.com
```

## Development

### To Build and Test locally
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/aif-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs and Deploy the Operator into the cluster:**

```sh
helm install aif-operator ./charts/aif-operator/ -n aif-operator \
    --create-namespace \
    --set manager.image.registry=<some-registry> \ 
    --set manager.image.repository=<repository-owner>/aif-operator \
    --set manager.image.tag=<tag>
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create CRs**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k samples/
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
helm uninstall aif-operator -n aif-operator
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete crd installaiextensions.ai-platform.suse.com
```

## Testing

1. **Install Rancher (or mock CRDs)**

2. **Install the operator:**

```bash
helm install aif-operator ./charts/aif-operator -n aif-operator
```

3. **Apply an extension:**
```bash
kubectl apply -f config/samples/installaiextension.yaml
```

4. **Observe reconciliation:**
```bash
kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=aif-operator -f -n aif-operator
```

5. **Verify resources:**
```bash
kubectl get installaiextensions
kubectl get uiplugins -A
kubectl get clusterrepos
helm list -A
```
